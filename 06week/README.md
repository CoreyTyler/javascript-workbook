Code Plan for Dodgeball Checkpoint

When starting dodgeball, I first copied the starter code into my .js file which game me an array of objects of people who I could add to my dodgeball teams.

I first started with making 3 empty arrays that would represent my list of players, my red team and my blue team.

Next I had to make my player classes adding all the attributed I needed for each player in my original array of players objects. as well as making functions that allow players to join the red or the blue team.

Next I extended the classes using the constructor with the required attributes.

Next I had to code a function that responded to the button press when clicking "List of People" and adds the players to an unordered list with a button attached. This Displays the people available in order to make them dodeball players.

Next was adding a function that responds to the click of the make player button and adds selected people and adds them to the list of players list with buttons attached to the name of players using the newplayers object adding whichever attributes are attached to the person in the new constructor.

Next I had to create functions that when you clicked the button associated to add them to the team, adds them to a new UL adding the mascot associated with the team as well as the team color though somehow my team color keeps coming out as undefined and me and my tutor couldnt figure out why.

Next I added a few tests with help from my tutor as well. I need a little more practice with making tests. But I made a few that my code passes.

I didnt have time to pretty it up with CSS but all of the html and js woork.
